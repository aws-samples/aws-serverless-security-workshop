# Module 4: Use SSL in-transit for your DB connections

Although we are using VPC and traffic is private within it, some regulations or compliance requirements might require encryption in transit. This encryption secures the data when communicating with the database. This will ensure that any traffic sniffing within your VPC won't result in a data breach.

Go to *dbUtils.js* to add a new property to your database connection. Under the method ***getDbConfig***, within the resolve object (a JSON object), add a new line to the JSON:

```
    ssl: "Amazon RDS",

```
The resolve should be like this:

<details>
<summary><strong>If you haven't gone through AWS Secrets Manager step</strong></summary><p>

```javascript
resolve({
    host: "xxxxxxxxxxxx.cluster-co70iacvvr8l.eu-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
    user: "admin",
    password: "Corp123!",
    database: "unicorn_customization",
    ssl: "Amazon RDS",
    multipleStatements: true
});
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>If you have gone through AWS Secrets Manager step</strong></summary><p>

```javascript
resolve({
    host: JSON.parse(secret).host,
    user: JSON.parse(secret).username,
    password: JSON.parse(secret).password,
    database: "unicorn_customization",
    ssl: "Amazon RDS",
	 multipleStatements: true
});
```
</details>

Finally, deploy these changes:

```bash
cd ~/environment/src
aws cloudformation package --output-template-file packaged.yaml --template-file template.yaml --s3-bucket $BUCKET --s3-prefix securityworkshop --region $REGION &&  aws cloudformation deploy --template-file packaged.yaml --stack-name CustomizeUnicorns --region $REGION --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM --parameter-overrides InitResourceStack=Secure-Serverless
```

Once this is done, you should be able to connect to the database using SSL.

##Â Ensure SSL - Optional step

You can require SSL connections for specific users accounts\. For example, you can use one of the following statements, depending on your MySQL version, to require SSL connections on the user account `encrypted_user`\.

For MySQL 5\.7 and later:

```
ALTER USER 'encrypted_user'@'%' REQUIRE SSL;            
```

For MySQL 5\.6 and earlier:

```
GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO 'encrypted_user'@'%' REQUIRE SSL;            
```

For more information on SSL connections with MySQL, go to the [MySQL documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/secure-connections.html)\.

## Next step 
You have now further secured your data by enabling encryption in transit for your database connection!
