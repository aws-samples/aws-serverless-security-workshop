# Serverless Security Workshop

In this workshop, you will learn techniques to secure a serverless application built with AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway and RDS Aurora. We will cover AWS services and features you can leverage to improve the security of a serverless applications in 5 domains: identity & access management, code, data, infrastructure, logging & monitoring.

You'll start by deploying a simple serverless application that allows third party companies to submit unicorn customizations. This will help Wild Rydes receive ad revenue and allow  third party companies to market their brand leveraging Wild Rydes's popularity. 

The simple serverless application has the below architecture to start with:

However, this simple serverless application is not very secure, and we need your help to implement measures to protect this serverless API from attackers. 

By following different modules covering various aspects of security, you will help improve the security of the simple serverless application. 

**Note**: The workshop is designed so you don't have to complete all the modules in order, with the exception of module 0 and 1: <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold"> You must start with module 0 and 1 before you work on other modules!</span>

Click on the link to module 0 below to get started deploying the simple serverless application that you will spend the rest of the workshop securing!
